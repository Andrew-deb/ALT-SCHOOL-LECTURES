Some lecture tips:

Ordered list: Elements can be accessed through indexes eg list, tuples etc.
Unordered list: Elements can only be acceseed through keys. eg. Dictionary, sets etc.
An Iterable is basically a list or array you can iterate over ie a string, list, tuples, dictionaries etc.

A Generator is a special type of iterable that generates values on the fly and does not store them in memory. They are defined using functions and the 'yield' statement.
zip function: The zip() function takes iterables (can be zero or more), aggregates them in a tuple, and returns it. It combines multiple iterables (like lists, tuples, strings) element by element into pairs (or tuples).

We can use the zip function to iterate over multiple iterables in parallel. For instance:
```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
res = dict()
for num, char in zip(list1, list2):
    res[num] = char # Creating a dictionary from two lists
print(res)  # Output: {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}
```

A Comprehension is a concise way to create lists, sets, or dictionaries using a single line of code. They consist of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause and optional if clauses.
Example of a list comprehension:
```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
```
